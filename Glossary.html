<dt id="term-ccpp">CCPP</dt><dd><p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://dtcenter.org/community-code/common-community-physics-package-ccpp">Common Community Physics Package</a> is a forecast-model agnostic, vetted collection of code containing atmospheric physical parameterizations and suites of parameterizations for use in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) along with a framework that connects the physics to the host forecast model.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-container">container</dt><dd><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container">Docker</a> describes a container as “a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.”</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-cycle">cycle</dt><dd><p>An hour of the day on which a forecast is started. In the Land DA System, it usually follows YYYYMMDD-HHmmss format.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-data-assimilation">data assimilation</dt><dd><p>One of the major sources of error in weather and climate forecasts is uncertainty related to the initial conditions that are used to generate future predictions. Even the most precise instruments have a small range of unavoidable measurement error, which means that tiny measurement errors (e.g., related to atmospheric conditions and instrument location) can compound over time. These small differences result in very similar forecasts in the short term (i.e., minutes, hours), but they cause widely divergent forecasts in the long term. Errors in weather and climate forecasts can also arise because models are imperfect representations of reality. Data assimilation systems seek to mitigate these problems by combining the most timely observational data with a “first guess” of the atmospheric state (usually a previous forecast) and other sources of data to provide a “best guess” analysis of the atmospheric state to start a weather or climate simulation. When combined with an “ensemble” of model runs (many forecasts with slightly different conditions), data assimilation helps predict a range of possible atmospheric states, giving an overall measure of uncertainty in a given forecast.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-forcing-data">forcing data</dt><dd><p>In coupled mode, data that are generated by one component of a model can be fed into another component to provide required input describing the state of the Earth system. When models are run in offline, or “uncoupled” mode, the model does not receive this input from another active component, so “forcing” files are provided. These files may consist of observational data or data gathered when running other components separately, and they contain values for the required input fields.</p>

Developed at NOAA’s <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/fv3/">Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory</a> (GFDL), it is a scalable and flexible dycore capable of both hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic atmospheric simulations.

<dt id="term-jedi">JEDI</dt><dd><p>The Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.jcsda.org/jcsda-project-jedi">JEDI</a>) is a unified and versatile data assimilation (DA) system for Earth System Prediction. It aims to enable efficient research and accelerated transition from research to operations by providing a framework that takes into account all components of the Earth system in a consistent manner. The JEDI software package can run on a variety of platforms and for a variety of purposes, and it is designed to readily accommodate new atmospheric and oceanic models and new observation systems. The <a class="reference external" href="https://jointcenterforsatellitedataassimilation-jedi-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/">JEDI User’s Guide</a> contains extensive information on the software.</p>
<p>JEDI is developed and distributed by the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.jcsda.org/">Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation</a>, a multi-agency research center hosted by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.ucar.edu/">UCAR</a>).

The <em>spack-stack</em> can be installed on a range of platforms and comes pre-configured for many systems. Users can install the necessary packages for a particular application and later add the missing packages for another application without having to rebuild the entire stack.</p>
